# JB_simple_cli
This repo contains implementation of my first project in JetBrains Academy course (https://hyperskill.org/tracks/25) - simple CLI program in ([JB_CLI.go](./JB_CLI.go)).

### About CLI
Program represents simple notepad with following functionality:  
-- There is opportunity to explicitly set a size of notepad storage  
-- You can create note by typing `create <text>` command  
-- View all the existing notes by `list` command  
-- Update pointed note by `update <position> <new text>` command  
-- Delete pointed note from notepad storage by `delete <position>` command  
-- Clean up notepad storage by `clear` command  
-- Stop notepad work by typing `exit` command  
-- Get command's help by typing `help`
